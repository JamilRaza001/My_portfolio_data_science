            <p>
              My journey into coding began quite by accident, filled with more
              setbacks than successes. I grew up in an English medium school
              where Urdu and Islamic Studies were not emphasized. When I took my
              intermediate exams, I unexpectedly failed both of my
              native-language papers. Just as I was regrouping, the COVID-19
              pandemic struck, delaying my HSC attempts for nearly three years.
              Faced with this uncertainty, my father encouraged me to explore
              computer science, even though I felt it wasn't for me and worried
              I would struggle without a formal background in the field.
              However, I signed up for a six-month web development boot camp,
              where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress.
              However, I never quite found my passion there. Undeterred, I then
              enrolled in a governance initiative IT program, diving into
              TypeScript and Next.js, only to realize that without a solid
              foundation, the concepts were difficult for me to grasp. That's
              when I discovered data science and thought, ‚ÄúIf I can master
              Python, maybe I can bridge the gap between my commerce background
              and the technical world.‚Äù By chance, I landed in the Saylani Mass
              IT Training program, where I took my first real plunge into Python
              for data analytics. Suddenly, I was energized by exploratory data
              analysis, statistical modeling, and the power of data to tell
              compelling stories. My commerce studies had taught me to think in
              business terms, and now I could combine that mindset with coding.
              Each challenge I faced, from failing my native language exams,
              navigating unfamiliar courses, and adapting to remote learning has
              sharpened my resilience. Today, I aspire not only to excel as a
              Data Scientist, AI Engineer, or Data Analyst but also to grow into
              a leadership role. My goal is to guide teams in harnessing data
              and AI to solve real-world problems and create opportunities for
              others who, like me, come from underprivileged beginnings.

                SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction Dashboard
              </h3>
              <p class="project-description">
                This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution that
                predicts the success of SpaceX launches, integrated into an
                interactive Streamlit dashboard. It fetches real-time data from
                the SpaceX API including launch details, rocket types and
                launchpad information and enhances it with simulated weather
                data (temperature, wind speed, and conditions) tied to launch
                dates and locations. The train_model.py script processes this
                data, encoding categorical variables like rocket and launchpad
                names with LabelEncoder, and trains a Random Forest Classifier
                on features such as weather conditions and temporal factors
                (year, month, day). The trained model and encoders are saved for
                deployment. The Streamlit app then loads these artifacts to
                offer a user-friendly interface with data filtering (by year and
                site), a Folium map visualizing launch site success rates, and
                analytical tabs showing rocket performance, weather impacts, and
                feature correlations. Users can also input custom parameters to
                predict launch success probabilities. This project impacts space
                enthusiasts and analysts by providing actionable insights into
                launch success factors, demonstrating robust data processing and
                machine learning pipelines, and offering an engaging tool for
                exploration all with a modular, maintainable codebase that could
                be extended with real weather data or advanced models.

              <p class="project-description">
                This project develops a predictive model and interactive
                dashboard for heart disease diagnosis, utilizing a dataset of
                1,025 patient records with features such as age, cholesterol and
                blood pressure. The code preprocesses the data by removing
                duplicates, splits it into training and test sets, and trains a
                Logistic Regression model to classify patients as having or not
                having heart disease, achieving an accuracy of 80-87% with
                k-fold cross-validation, which validates its robustness. The
                Streamlit application enhances this by offering a user-friendly
                interface with visualizations‚Äîsuch as target distribution,
                age-cholesterol scatter plots, and correlation
                heatmaps‚Äîalongside a prediction tool where users input patient
                data to receive real-time risk assessments with probability
                scores. This project impacts healthcare by providing an
                accessible tool for early detection, demonstrating proficiency
                in machine learning and data visualization, and offers potential
                for expansion with feature scaling or advanced models to address
                convergence warnings.

                Real Estate Price Prediction Dashboard
              </h3>
              <p class="project-description">
                This project provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard for
                predicting real estate prices using a Random Forest Regressor,
                built on a dataset of house prices per unit area that includes
                features like distance to MRT stations and the number of
                convenience stores. The code preprocesses data by converting
                fractional transaction dates into datetime objects and
                extracting the year and month, then trains a tuned model with
                GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters, achieving high
                R-squared scores on both training (up to 0.9) and test sets. The
                dashboard offers a comprehensive overview with data summaries,
                exploratory visualizations (such., house price distribution and
                geographic plots), model performance metrics, and a prediction
                tool where users input property details to receive real-time
                price estimates. This project benefits real estate stakeholders
                by providing a data-driven pricing tool, demonstrates advanced
                machine learning techniques and data visualization skills, and
                could be further improved with additional features like
                real-time market data integration.

                services and payment methods, the project employs logistic
                regression and decision tree classifiers to pinpoint customers
                at risk of leaving. Ultimately, it achieves the ability to
                provide actionable insights, enabling the company to implement
                targeted retention strategies. By solving the problem of
                unpredictable customer loss, the project helps reduce churn
                rates, enhance customer loyalty, and drive overall business
                success.

                This project delivers an end to end exploration of customer
                demographics by blending robust data processing with rich visual
                storytelling. Leveraging pandas, it ingests and cleans raw
                customer records to uncover patterns in gender balance,
                pinpointing not only overall male to female ratios but also how
                these shift across defined life stages. Through dynamic age
                group segmentation, the analysis surfaces nuanced insights
                highlighting, for instance, the concentration of young adults in
                specific regions and the rising prevalence of older cohorts in
                others.

                From Dollars to Decades: GDP's Impact on Life Expectancy
              </h3>
              <p class="project-description">
                I conducted a comprehensive analysis of global country data to
                uncover the relationship between economic output and population
                health. First, I ingested and cleaned the dataset using pandas
                and NumPy, then calculated life expectancy quartiles to group
                countries by health outcomes. Next, I visualized the
                distribution of life expectancy across all nations and
                separately for high and low GDP groups‚Äîusing annotated
                histograms in Seaborn to highlight key differences. To deepen
                the insight, I identified countries that outperformed or
                underperformed their economic peers by examining life expectancy
                thresholds within each GDP bracket. This project demonstrates my
                ability to blend data manipulation, statistical summarization,
                and clear visual storytelling to extract meaningful patterns
                from complex datasets.

                Mapping Income & Gender: A State Level Census Analysis
              </h3>
              <p class="project-description">
                I combined ten state level CSVs into a unified US census
                DataFrame, then cleaned and transformed demographic
                fields‚Äîstripping percentage signs, parsing gender counts, and
                converting income to numeric‚Äîto ensure accurate analysis. By
                calculating the female population share per state, I plotted a
                clear scatterplot of average state income against women's
                proportion, revealing correlation trends across 51 states. I
                also prepared histograms of key demographic variables (race
                percentages, income, gender counts) to examine their
                distributions and identify outliers. This project demonstrates
                end to end data engineering skills merging multiple sources,
                rigorous type casting, and handling duplicates‚Äîalongside
                exploratory visual analytics using matplotlib and Seaborn. The
                outcome provides actionable insights into socio economic
                patterns and supports data driven policy discussions.

              </h3>
              <p class="project-description">
                I conducted a location wise inventory audit for a garden supply
                chain, focusing on Queens's nine product lines. First, I loaded
                and inspected the CSV data to capture key fields product type,
                description, quantity, and price and filtered for Queens
                entries. Next, I flagged stock availability with an in_stock
                boolean and calculated each item's total_value (quantity *
                price), revealing top value SKUs like wheelbarrows worth $8,819
                and terracotta planters at $1,565. I also identified out of
                stock concerns‚ÄîQueens's insect killer is currently unavailable
                enabling targeted restocking actions. Finally, I enriched labels
                by concatenating product_type and product_description into a
                full_description field for streamlined reporting and
                searchability.

              <p class="project-description">
                I performed an end to end funnel analysis of user behavior on an
                e-commerce site by integrating four timestamped datasets‚Äîvisits,
                cart additions, checkouts, and purchases using pandas and NumPy.
                After merging and cleaning the data, I calculated stage to stage
                conversion rates, revealing that only 17.4% of visitors added
                items to their carts, making it the biggest drop off point. I
                then examined the checkout to purchase transition, finding an
                impressive 83.1% completion rate among those who reached the
                checkout page. To understand user pace, I converted timestamps
                to time deltas and computed the average time from initial visit
                to final purchase just under 44 minutes. This project showcases
                my ability to wrangle multi-table event data, quantify key
                performance metrics, and surface actionable insights for
                optimizing the sales funnel.
